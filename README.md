# Wii-Blue

Wii-Blue is gesture recognition software that can be taught gestures to be recognized using a Wiimote, and perform command line actions.  It uses
Ryan Pavlik's Wiiuse and Tim Swast's Pywiiuse to connect the Wiimote to a Linux machine via Bluetooth and gather sensor readings from the remote.

Wiiuse:  https://github.com/rpavlik/wiiuse

Pywiiuse:  https://github.com/tswast/pywiiuse

To run Wii-Blue:

1)  Install wiiuse and pywiiuse, following instructions given in their respective repositories

2)  Enable Bluetooth

3)  Prepare wiimote for use


After downloading Wii-Blue code, Run:

python connect.py

From the Wii-Blue folder you have created.  The program will provide prompts from that point forward to guide you through its interaction.
